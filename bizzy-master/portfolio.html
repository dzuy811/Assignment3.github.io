        <img style = "height: 400px; width: 950px" src = "images/img2.jpg">
        <br>
        <p class="text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Nutrition and Fitness are operated on both IOS and Android. Moreover, it is free for people to download and use it. This web makes a profit from the number of downloads and users.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">There are three main features that customers are able to choose are Diet, Lose Weight and Fitness.
    After signing an account up for Nutrition and Fitness, it will require customers to provide their name, age, height and weight so that this web can process and calculate the calories in which people can consume every meal.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Subsequently, customers will choose one of the three options that I mentioned above then this web will base on it to calculate exactly the amount of calories for each option.</p>
        <br>
                <p class="text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Firstly, Diet is a mode for customers who aim to keep fit and maintain their health. In this mode, Nutrition and Fitness just focuses on nutrients that customers consume each meal. Every day, this web will recommend for customers dishes which are good for their health and list the nutrients which contain in these dishes. Moreover, in case customers do not like following Nutrition and Fitness’ meals, they are able to think about what they will eat today then add to the web. This web will process and provide customers the number of calories which contains in those meals. After that, this web will give customers some advice and show the disadvantage if customers consume these dishes.</p>
        <br>
        <img style = "height: 400px; width: 950px" src = "images/img1.jpg">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Secondly, this feature for people who are losing weight. Nutrition and Fitness will base on the customers’ height and weight to calculate calories. Initially, this web will require customers to provide the number of weight that they want to lose so that it could help customers to meet their goals. Nutrition and Fitness will base on this information to generate for customers a schedule and dishes per day. To be specific, the web will calculate how many hours that customers should spend on doing exercises. In addition, the web also provides plenty of delicious dishes that are good for customers’ health and a balanced diet. Every week, the web will check the latest customers’ weight to compare with the previous so that Nutrition and Fitness could add some exercise lessons or change the limitation of calories per day for clients.</p>
        <br>
        <img style = "height: 400px; width: 950px" src = "images/img3.jpg">
         <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="text-left" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">Lastly, this feature is called Fitness because it supports customers to build their bodies. However, Nutrition and Fitness will require customers to pay 20 USD per month. To be specific, it is not easy for people to have 6 packs, it is a process of doing gymnastics and maintain diet. Nonetheless, by using this web, it is easier for customers to have beautiful body shape and muscles. The Nutrition and Fitness will form a schedule of working out for customers. For example, customers will work on shoulder and back arm muscles on Monday and the web will provide some exercises for each group of muscles. Moreover, the web also provides some special meals which contains moderately amount of calories. However, there is another option for people who do not want to follow the web’s schedule, they are able to build a schedule on their own by searching the part of the muscle that they want to build or develop. After that, the web will suggest some exercises for customers to add to their schedule.</p>
